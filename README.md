### Hello 👋

I'm Tom. I write code, mostly in Python. I still don't understand SQL, even after over two decades of using it.

#### Now 🕐
- 🛠️ Lead develoer at [@scene-connect](https://github.com/scene-connect).
- 🦄 [Django](https://github.com/django/django) contributor (sometimes).
- 💼 I do freelance work, but not actively looking right now.

#### I spend too much time thinking about... 💭
- 🌱 Fixing the climate and biodiversity crises.
- 🦾 How simple web accessibility would be if developers didn't try to be so clever.
- ⏱️ Web performance, and its impact on energy use.
- 🔏 Cyberseurity's impact on society.
- 🤔 Why fools and fanatics are so certain of themselves.
